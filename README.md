Sound #1: made a cube to the left of the starting position containing a wind sound using 3D spatial blend with the volume rolloff changed to how I want it to be.

Sound #2: made another cute to the right of the starting position that uses a script to play a sound when you move through it. The player has a cracking sound attached to them that doesn't play on awake, but does play when you move through this specific cube with it's trigger.

Sound #3: made a 3D ambient sound of birds chirping throughout the level. It can be heard when starting up the game and it fades away as you move the player away from it. It is behind the player when the game starts.
